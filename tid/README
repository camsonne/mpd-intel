 Trigger Interface/Distribution (TID) Module Library

This library contains routines for access and use of the JLab TID.  It
also includes routines for operation and access to the JLab SD (Signal
Distribution) and Jlab CTP (Crate Trigger Processor) via I^2C.

This library and CODA readout lists (Linux only) are in a development
state (so called BETA version).  This is due to that fact that the
hardware (and its associated firmware) is still in heavy development.
