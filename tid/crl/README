- Library build
  In directory tid/, build the library with
     make

  Be sure that the ARCH is undefined in the Makefile, or defined
  as VXWORKSPPC

  This library (tidLib.o), must be loaded by the controller, prior
  to "Download" in CODA.

- Readout list build.
  Build the example tid_list.o with
     ./makelist.local tid_list ppc -I../

  The makelist.local must be used to override the GEN_source.h
  in the CODA distribution with the local modified version.

- Some configurable TID routines/options (see the source for more):

TRIG_ADDR
  The A24 address of the TID.  By hardware default, this is the VME
  slot number (in a VME 64X crate), shifted by 19 bits.
   e.g.  VME Slot  2 = ( 2<<19) = 0x100000
         VME Slot 21 = (21<<19) = 0xA80000

TRIG_MODE
  How the TID is triggered:
   0: External Trigger - Interrupt Mode
   1: TS/TImaster Trigger - Interrupt Mode
   2: External Trigger - Polling Mode
   3: TS/TImaster Trigger - Polling Mode

 0 or 2 should be used (Master mode) in a single crate system.  TID's configured
 as SLAVE devices must use 1 or 3.

Set number of events per block 
  tidSetBlockLevel(1);

For Front panel TS Inputs, 
 - e.g. Enable TS Input #1 
   (Unterminated Inputs MUST NOT be enabled)
  tidDisableTSInput( TID_TSINPUT_ALL );
  tidEnableTSInput( TID_TSINPUT_1 );

Set the Block Acknowledge threshold 
  0:  No threshold  -  Pipeline mode
  1:  One Acknowdge for each Block - "ROC LOCK" mode
  2-255:  "Buffered" mode.
  tidSetBlockAckThreshold(1);

Front panel trigger prescale: 2^<arg> 
  tidSetPrescale(0);
